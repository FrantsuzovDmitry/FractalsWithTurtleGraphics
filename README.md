# FractalsWithTurtleGraphics
A project for building any 2D fractals (using L-systems) using turtle graphics in C# WinForms.

The project is called Lab 3 because I did this work as part of a computer graphics lab.
In the course of the work, experience was gained with:
- external library
- wrapping closed class methods for my own needs
- adding functionality to an existing library
- recursion and stack
